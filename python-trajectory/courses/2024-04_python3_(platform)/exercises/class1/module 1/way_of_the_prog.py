# What are correct ways to tell a turtle named Tex to move forward 20 pixels? Select as many as apply.

# A. Tex.forward(20)
# E. Tex.forward(10 + 10)

#--------

# Which is the correct way to make a new instance of the Turtle class?

# B. turtle.Turtle()

#--------

# What does each instance of the Turtle class represent?

# C. A unique 'turtle' that you can use to draw.

#--------

# Select all of the following things that methods can do:

# A. Change the value of an attribute.
# B. Return values.
# C. Create new attributes of an instance and set their values.

#--------

# For an instance of a class that is assigned to the variable student, what is the proper way to refer to the title attribute/instance variable?

# E. student.title

#--------

# What is the name of jane‚Äôs attribute (not method) that is referred to in the following code?
# x

import turtle

jane = turtle.Turtle()
jane.forward(20)
print(jane.x)

#--------

# What are the names of the instances in the following code? Please put one instance per blank space and enter them in the order that the computer would read them.
# wn jazz pop

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()

jazz = turtle.Turtle()
jazz.forward(50)

pop = turtle.Turtle()
pop.left(180)

# Write code to draw a regular pentagon (a five-sided figure with all sides the same length).
import turtle

#--------

# Write a program that uses the turtle module to draw something. It doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated, but draw something different than we have done in the past. 
# (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting .speed(10) for the turtle to draw fast, or .
# speed(0) for it to draw super fast with no animation.)
