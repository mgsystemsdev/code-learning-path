# === Simple Python Output and Variables Demo ===

print("")  # Prints a blank line for spacing in output

age = 5  # Stores the number 5 in a variable called 'age'
print(age * 2)  # Multiplies age by 2 (result: 10) and prints it

print("")  # Another blank line for visual separation

name = "Miguel"  # Stores the name 'Miguel' as a string in the variable 'name'
age = 35  # Updates the 'age' variable to 35

# Prints the name and age with labels, using '\n' for line breaks
print("\nName: " + name + "\n Age: " + str(age) + "\n")

print("")  # Blank line to keep the output tidy

greeting = "Hello World"  # Stores the greeting 'Hello World' in a variable
print(greeting)  # Outputs the value stored in 'greeting'

print("")  # Adds a line break to visually separate blocks of output

print("")  # Adds an extra blank line

name = "miguel"  # Sets the variable 'name' again to a lowercase string
print("Hello " + name )  # Concatenates and prints a personal greeting

print("")  # Adds another blank line after the greeting

print("")  # Empty line to structure output spacing

print("Welcome to Python")  # Prints a welcome message to the user

print("")  # Blank line to finish this section

print("")  # Starts a new section with an empty line

# Demonstrates line breaks and indentation in strings using escape characters
print("Line1\nLine2\n\tIndented Line3")

print("")  # Final blank line to end the output cleanly
